# pyvo_examples

This repository contains examples of pyvo, the python API to Virtual Observatory services. 
These examples proved useful at one point in the past and were meant for teaching and outreach purposes. Hence, the scripts are very simple and for the sake of readability may not exactly show best python coding practices.
